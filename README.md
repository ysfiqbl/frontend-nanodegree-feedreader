# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds using the Google Feed API and it uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), the behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code to practice "test-driven development". It is a fork of the [Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree Feed Reader](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

## Instructions
You can view the app [here](https://ysfiqbl.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).
You can also download and extract the zip file and open the index.html file in your favorite javascript enabled browser.
